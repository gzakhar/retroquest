# Action Items: Core Concept

## What Retrospectives Produce

During a retrospective, team members share opinions, suggestions, and observations. When something resonates with enough people, the facilitator creates an **action item**—a commitment to make an adjustment.

## The Assumption

If action items were followed through on more consistently, teams would improve over time.

RetroQuest exists to test this assumption by making follow-through visible and rewarded.

## Action Item Structure

Each action item has:

- **Description**: What needs to be done
- **Owner**: The participant responsible for completing it
- **Verifiers**: Other participants (not the owner) who will judge completion
- **Verification threshold**: How many verifiers must approve for it to count as complete

The facilitator sets the number of verifiers and the threshold when creating the action item.

## Lifecycle

### Creation

During the Discuss stage, the facilitator creates action items based on what the team voted on. The facilitator assigns an owner, selects verifiers from the other participants, and sets the verification threshold.

### Follow-up

At the start of a new retrospective, the facilitator selects a previous board to "follow up on." This brings that board's action items into the current session for verification.

### Verification

Each verifier votes on whether the owner completed the action item. If the number of positive votes meets or exceeds the threshold, the action is marked complete.

### Reward

When an action item is verified as complete, the owner's score increases.

## What This Document Is

This is the first step toward gamifying the platform. It captures the minimal concept needed for implementation.

Future extensions (streaks, team scores, token rewards, etc.) are out of scope for now.
