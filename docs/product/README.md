# Product Documentation

This directory contains product specifications and feature documentation for RetroQuest.

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [retrospective-flow.md](./retrospective-flow.md) | The five-stage retrospective flow specification |
| [action-items-vision.md](./action-items-vision.md) | Core concept for action items and basic gamification |

## Purpose

These documents serve as **reference material**—detailed specifications that Claude can consult when implementing features. They differ from CLAUDE.md files in that:

- **CLAUDE.md** = Behavioral guidance ("how should I think?")
- **Product docs** = Specifications ("what should I build?")

## Contributing

When adding new product documentation:

1. Keep documents focused on a single feature or flow
2. Include rationale, not just requirements (the "why" matters)
3. Mark speculative/future items clearly
4. Update this README with new documents

## Status

RetroQuest is early-stage. These documents will evolve as the product develops. Current state:

- **Implemented**: Retrospective stages (Setup through Discuss)
- **Not yet implemented**: Action item persistence, gamification, Web3 integration
